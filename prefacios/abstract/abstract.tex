\chapter*{Abstract}

Due to the necessity of high quality softwares and not enough time for activities like validation and verification, were developed software testing techniques in order to identify and correct relevant errors from the system, supporting the development and also integrating the entire application life cicle.

Amongst the techniques created, one of then is the automation of tests, that in way the running it software development if becomes a powerful strategy to minimize the effort with testing activities, especially regression testing.

In order to find as soon as possible any flaw, this work represents a test automation strategy throughout the life cycle of the development of an application. Participating in all stages of the development, carrying through activities jointly with the collaborator to cover all the possible levels of of system implementation. 

The results obtained highlight the impact of such a strategy in the accomplishment of the tests, make possible the application of tests automatized during the development and stand out the importance of the final quality of the product with this type of automation.
